## Introduction

You're familiar with the certainties of death and taxes. What about the concept of risk? Indeed, risk is just as ingrained in life as those other certainties. This fact became all the more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, as each of us found ourselves evaluating and reevaluating our personal risk considerations with the arrival of each new wave of the pandemic and its associated disruptions. This parallel holds true in the realm of business as well, where executives and organizations possess varying degrees of comfort when it comes to managing and mitigating risk.

Where does business risk originate? To begin with, external factors can significantly impact an organization's meticulously laid-out plans. These external factors may encompass elements such as inflation, disruptions in the supply chain, geopolitical shifts, unpredictable force majeure events like global pandemics or climate-related disasters, competition, issues related to reputation, or even cyberattacks.

However, at times, the source of risk lies within the organization itself. Companies can be endangered by decisions made by their own leadership or by the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. Yet, perhaps the most detrimental risk of all is the potential for missed opportunities. This scenario is all too familiar: when companies opt not to embrace disruptive innovation, they run the risk of losing ground to more agile competitors.

The modern era is characterized by a growing frequency of shocks related to sociopolitical, economic, and climate factors. In just 2019 alone, there were 40 weather-related disasters that resulted in damages exceeding $1 billion each. To remain competitive, organizations must adopt flexible strategies for handling risk and building resilience. This entails forecasting new threats, recognizing shifts in existing threats, and formulating comprehensive response plans. There's no magical formula that can guarantee smooth navigation through a crisis. However, in moments of peril, a well-structured risk management strategy may be the only thing that shields an organization from disruptions to its critical business operations. For further insights on evaluating and preparing for the inevitability of risk, continue reading.

## What is risk management?

Risk management involves implementing measures to recognize, handle, and mitigate threats. Organizations can establish these measures through various risk management approaches and activities. After identifying and assessing a risk, risk management measures can be devised to diminish the potential consequences. The ideal approach is always risk elimination, but there are alternative risk management methods. Loss mitigation and reduction represent other risk management approaches that acknowledge the risk while striving to minimize potential losses (insurance is a form of loss mitigation). Another approach to risk management is redundancy (also known as duplication). Backup servers or generators serve as a typical example of redundancy, ensuring that in case of a power outage, no data or productivity is compromised.

However, for an organization to formulate appropriate risk management measures, it must first gain an understanding of potential threats.

## What are the three key elements of a comprehensive risk management strategy?

A proactive risk management plan can be divided into three essential components: identifying potential new risks and vulnerabilities in existing risk management measures, determining the organization's willingness to tolerate risk, and selecting the appropriate risk management approach. Here's more detail on each phase and how to execute them:

### 1. Detecting Risks and Addressing Vulnerabilities

Taking a static approach to risk is inadequate, as organizations can be caught unprepared when unexpected events, such as a pandemic, occur. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain a proactive stance. To adapt to changing circumstances, businesses should address the following three questions for each relevant risk:

- How will a risk evolve over time? Risks can manifest as gradual developments or sudden occurrences, following cyclical or permanent patterns. Companies should analyze the likely progression of known risks and regularly reassess them.

- Are we ready to handle systemic risks? Increasingly, risks have long-term repercussions for reputation or regulation, affecting entire industries, economies, or societies. A comprehensive risk management strategy should encompass all types of risks, including systemic ones.

- What new risks may emerge in the future? Organizations should devise innovative methods to identify forthcoming risks. Traditional approaches relying on historical reviews and assessments are no longer sufficient.

### 2. Evaluating Risk Tolerance

How can companies establish a structured approach to deciding which risks to embrace and which to avoid? Firms should define risk tolerance levels that align with their values, strategies, capabilities, competitive landscapes, and societal considerations. To this end, consider three key questions:

- How much risk should we assume? Companies should frequently reevaluate their risk profiles in response to changing customer behaviors, digital capabilities, competitive dynamics, and global trends.

- Are there risks we must unequivocally reject? Some risks, like criminal activities or sexual harassment, warrant clear rejection. Others, such as economic volatility and climate change, require a nuanced response, dependent on the specific industry, business, and risk tolerance.

- Does our risk tolerance appropriately reflect the effectiveness of our controls? Companies often prefer risks for which they possess robust control mechanisms. However, evolving risks challenge conventional assumptions about control effectiveness. For instance, increased automation may enhance speed but also raise concerns about data breaches and privacy issues. Organizations must adapt their risk profiles accordingly.

### 3. Choosing a Risk Management Approach

Lastly, organizations must decide how to respond when confronted with a new risk. This decision-making process should be agile and inclusive, involving leaders from various departments and objectively assessing past experiences. Consider the following three questions organizations should be prepared to answer:

- How can we mitigate the risks we are embracing? Ultimately, individuals need to make these decisions and evaluate control effectiveness. Automated control systems, guided by advanced analytics, can complement human efforts, mitigating quantifiable risks and minimizing false positives.

- What steps should we take if a risk event occurs or control measures fail? Companies should be ready to transition to crisis management mode swiftly, guided by established protocols. Organizations with well-practiced crisis management capabilities handle shocks better, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- How can we cultivate genuine resilience? Resilient companies not only endure threats but emerge stronger. The most resilient firms transform crises into competitive advantages. True resilience arises from diverse skills, innovation, creative problem-solving, and a supportive environment that fosters peak performance.

Change is a constant factor. A risk management strategy should not only involve creating plans based on potential risk scenarios but also regularly evaluating and updating those plans to remain relevant.

## What are five steps organizations can take to develop adaptable risk management?

Historically, some businesses have regarded risk management as a mundane subject, lacking appeal for executives aiming to gain a competitive edge. However, in situations of severe or abrupt risks, an effective risk strategy can be the difference between survival and adversity. Here are five actions leaders can implement to establish robust risk management capabilities.

1. Reframe the vision for risk management: This involves setting clear goals and defining risk levels and tolerance. Risk managers should engage in conversations with business leaders to grasp how individuals across the organization perceive risk. They should also share potential strategies to foster well-informed decision-making regarding risk versus reward, along with available resources for execution.

2. Establish agile risk management procedures: As the risk landscape becomes increasingly unpredictable, the need for agile risk management practices intensifies. Practically, this entails forming cross-functional teams with the authority to swiftly make decisions concerning risk innovation and management.

3. Leverage data and analytics: Digital tools can aid companies in enhancing their risk management efforts. Data from both traditional and nontraditional sources can enrich organizations' understanding of risk, while algorithms can enhance error detection and facilitate more precise predictions.

4. Cultivate future-ready risk expertise: Risk managers who are equipped to confront future challenges must acquire fresh competencies and broaden their domain knowledge, encompassing model risk management, data analysis, and technology. This will enable them to provide effective guidance to their organizations by understanding the evolving risk landscape.

5. Strengthen risk culture: Risk culture encompasses the mindset and behavioral norms that shape an organization's relationship with risk. An effective risk culture enables an organization to respond swiftly when threats arise.

## How do scenarios aid business leaders in grasping uncertainty?

When conducted effectively, scenario planning prompts business leaders to transform abstract hypotheses regarding uncertainties into narratives depicting plausible future scenarios. Proficient scenario planning allows decision-makers to experience new realities on intellectual, sensory, rational, and emotional levels. Scenarios offer four primary advantages for organizations navigating uncertain circumstances.

1. Expanding thinking: By constructing a spectrum of potential outcomes, each supported by a sequence of events leading to them, scenario planning encourages expansive thinking. This helps organizations prepare for a range of potential future scenarios and acknowledge the possibility of rapid change.

2. Revealing inevitable or likely futures: Comprehensive scenario-building efforts can identify influential drivers of change, aiding in the prediction of potential outcomes. In essence, scenario building highlights critical events from the past that can indicate highly probable future developments.

3. Safeguarding against groupthink: In some large corporations, employees may hesitate to express contrarian viewpoints, fearing repercussions from management. Scenarios can serve as a safe platform for presenting dissenting opinions that diverge from senior leadership and established strategies.

4. Encouraging challenge to conventional wisdom: Particularly in large corporations, a strong bias toward maintaining the status quo can prevail. Scenarios offer a non-confrontational method for presenting alternative futures that challenge the assumptions underpinning the current strategy.

## What are the latest insights regarding risk in financial institutions?

In late 2021, a survey-based research initiative, not conducted by McKinsey, involved over 30 chief risk officers (CROs) who provided insights into the current state of the banking sector, risk management practices, and future priorities.

According to the CROs, banks are facing heightened exposure to rapidly evolving market dynamics, climate change, and cybercrime in the current environment. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed CROs noted that the pandemic had a significant impact on employees and nonfinancial risk. Most expected these effects to diminish within the next three years.

Conversely, climate change is predicted to become an increasingly substantial concern over time. Nearly all respondents identified climate regulation as one of the top five influential forces in the financial industry over the next three years. Moreover, 75 percent expressed concern about climate-related transition risk, encompassing financial and other risks stemming from the transition away from carbon-based energy systems.

Lastly, cybercrime emerged as a top risk, both presently and in the future, according to most executives.

## What is cyber risk?

Cyber risk represents a facet of business risk, encompassing potential losses in the digital realm—comprising financial, reputational, operational, productivity, and regulatory aspects. While its origins lie in digital threats, cyber risk can also manifest as physical world losses, such as damage to operational equipment.

Distinguishing cyber risk from cyberthreats is crucial. Cyberthreats denote specific perils that create the potential for cyber risk. These threats include privilege escalation (exploiting system flaws for unauthorized access), vulnerability exploitation (exploiting detected system vulnerabilities), and phishing. Cyberthreats can result in losses encompassing the compromise of digital asset confidentiality, integrity, and availability, along with fraud, financial misconduct, data loss, or system unavailability.

Historically, organizations have leaned on maturity-based cybersecurity strategies to manage cyber risk. These strategies center on attaining a particular level of cybersecurity maturity through capability-building, like establishing a security operations center or implementing multifactor authentication across the organization. While maturity-based approaches remain valuable for nascent organizations, for most, they can become unwieldy endeavors, necessitating the monitoring and analysis of all facets of an organization. In reality, organizations often fare better by measuring and addressing their most critical vulnerabilities.

### What is a risk-based cybersecurity approach?

A risk-based cybersecurity approach signifies a distinct shift from a maturity-based one. Notably, it places risk reduction as the primary objective, prioritizing investments based on the effectiveness of a cybersecurity program in reducing risk. Additionally, a risk-based approach translates risk reduction targets into precise implementation programs with clear alignment throughout the organization. Rather than deploying controls indiscriminately, organizations can concentrate on fortifying defenses against the most severe vulnerabilities.

Here are eight recommended steps constituting a best practice for developing a risk-based cybersecurity approach:

1. Integrate cybersecurity into the enterprise risk management framework.
2. Define sources of enterprise value across teams, processes, and technologies.
3. Evaluate enterprise-wide vulnerabilities, both internal and for third parties, across people, processes, and technology.
4. Comprehend the relevant "threat actors," including their capabilities and intent.
5. Establish links between controls in operational activities and change programs, vulnerabilities they address, and identify the need for new efforts.
6. Map enterprise risks from the enterprise risk management framework, considering threat actors, vulnerabilities, and security controls.
7. Assess risks in relation to enterprise risk appetite and report on how cybersecurity efforts reduce enterprise risk.
8. Monitor risks and cybersecurity efforts against risk appetite, key cyber risk indicators, and key performance indicators.

## How can leaders make prudent investments in risk management?

Neglecting high-consequence, low-likelihood risks can have dire consequences for organizations, yet preparing for all eventualities is prohibitively expensive. For instance, the COVID-19 crisis, while unexpected on its current scale, was foreseeable, and yet many companies were unprepared, leading to over 50 billion-dollar companies in the United States filing for bankruptcy in 2020.

In managing these high-consequence, low-likelihood risks, often referred to as "big bets," decision-makers face the challenge of prioritization due to their sheer number. To streamline this process, organizations can distinguish between risks that could harm the business and those that could potentially lead to its demise. It is vital to prioritize threats that pose existential risks to the organization.

To identify such risks, employing a two-by-two risk grid is recommended. This grid assesses the potential impact of an event on the entire organization against the level of certainty regarding the impact. This way, risks can be evaluated in relative terms rather than on an absolute scale.

While some organizations endure existential crises, it's essential to acknowledge that crises, along with missed opportunities, can lead to organizational failure. By gauging the impact of high-impact, low-likelihood risks on core business functions, leaders can pinpoint and mitigate risks that pose existential threats. Additionally, investments aimed at safeguarding their value propositions can enhance an organization's overall resilience.
