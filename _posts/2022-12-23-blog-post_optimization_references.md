My list of reference materials containing for mathematical optimisation, based on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-resources-to-learn-about-optimization).

# Lecture notes

Highly recommended: video lectures by Prof. S. Boyd at Stanford, this is a rare case where watching live lectures is better than reading a book.
