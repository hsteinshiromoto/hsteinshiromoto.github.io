## 2. Introduction

In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model being learned). Hyperparameters are often chosen by a human designer before training the model. They can have a significant impact on the performance of the model on unseen data, so finding good values for them is often a crucial part of the machine learning pipeline. Some examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate and regularization strength in a neural network, the kernel and regularization strength in support vector machines, and the number of clusters to use in a clustering algorithm.

Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate a model hyperparameters by training it on a portion of the available data and evaluating it on the remaining portion. This allows us to assess the model's performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting. In cross-validation, the process of choosing hyperparameters can be done by trying out different combinations of hyperparameters on the training data and evaluating their performance on the validation data, then selecting the combination that performs the best. This can help ensure that the final model is not overfitting to the training data.

There are several techniques for performing cross-validation, including:

* K-fold cross-validation: In this method, the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining k-1 subsets as the training set. The final performance measure is then the average of the performance on each fold.

* Stratified k-fold cross-validation: This is similar to k-fold cross-validation, but it ensures that the proportions of different classes in the data are preserved in each fold, which can be important for imbalanced datasets.

* Leave-one-out cross-validation: This is a special case of k-fold cross-validation where k is set to the size of the dataset, which means that each time the model is trained on all the data except for one example, which is used as the validation set. This can be computationally expensive but can give more accurate estimates of performance.

* Repeated k-fold cross-validation: This method involves running k-fold cross-validation multiple times and averaging the performance measures to get a more stable estimate of the model's performance.

Overall, cross-validation is a valuable tool for evaluating machine learning models and selecting the best hyperparameters.

Another method to find optimal hyperparameters is Bayesian optimization. Bayesian optimization is a technique for optimizing a function that is expensive to evaluate. It is based on the Bayesian inference framework, which is a way of updating beliefs about a quantity of interest as more evidence becomes available. In Bayesian optimization, the function to be optimized is called the objective function, and the goal is to find the input that maximizes the objective function. The objective function is often a black box, meaning that we don't know how it works, but we can evaluate it by passing in different inputs and observing the output. The Bayesian optimization algorithm uses a probabilistic model to represent the objective function and iteratively updates the model as more evidence becomes available. The algorithm then uses the model to suggest the next input to evaluate, which is the input that is most likely to maximize the objective function. This process is repeated until the algorithm has enough evidence to be confident that it has found the input that maximizes the objective function.

In the context of hyperparameter optimization, this function could be the performance of a machine learning model on a validation set, and the inputs to the function would be the values of the hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization works by building a probabilistic model of the function based on the available data, and then using this model to choose the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate. This allows the algorithm to balance exploration (trying out new hyperparameter values to improve the model of the function) and exploitation (choosing the values that are expected to lead to the best performance).

In this blog post, we will see how to employ Bayesian optimization with cross validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model. We will use the scikit-learn library to build a machine learning model and the pandas library to load and manipulate the data.
