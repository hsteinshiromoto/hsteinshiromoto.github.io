The `value_counts()` function in the popular python data science library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) is a quick way to count the unique values in a single column otherwise known as a series of data.

This function is extremely useful for very quickly performing some basic data analysis on specific columns of data contained in a Pandas DataFrame.

This post will show you how with a few additions to your code you can actually do quite a lot of analysis using this function.
